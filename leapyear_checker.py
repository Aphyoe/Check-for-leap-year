#Rules of leap year!
#on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
#if the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 its a leap year or 
#if the year is divisible by 4 and divisible by 100 and also divisible by 400.

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 != 0:
        print("Leap year.")
    elif year % 400 == 0:
        print("Leap year.")
